= dnssd =

This directory holds the containers necessary for running the DNS-SD version of the Arrowhead Service Registry.

In this implementation by AITIA, service information is stored in DNS-SD format in a <code>bind</code> server. For an implementation using relational databases, see <code>jdbc</code>.

The Service Registry service is implemented as a stand-alone Java application located in <code>service_jse/</code>, which can use any sufficiently compliant DNS-SD provider. A pre-configured server is given in <code>bind</code>.
