= Docker: Database 3.2 =

This is a ''dockerized'' version of the MySQL/MariaDB database pre-configured for working with the Arrowhead Framework V3.2 core services.

== Instructions ==

== Usage ==

First, create a Docker network for other containers to connect to this one. This step is not necessary if you have created the network previously.

<pre>docker network create ahf</pre>
Then, run the database container.

<pre>docker run -t --rm \
           --network ahf \
           --publish 3306:3306 \
           --name=ahf-db arrowheadf/db:3.2</pre>
To stop the container, you need to run the following command. This is because of how the official Docker MySQL image is configured.

<pre>docker stop ahf-db</pre>
== Environment Variables ==

The environment variables in this container are the same as for the official MySQL Docker one.

* <code>MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD</code>
* <code>MYSQL_DATABASE</code>
* <code>MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASSWORD</code>
* <code>MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD</code>
* <code>MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD</code>
* <code>MYSQL_ONETIME_PASSWORD</code>
