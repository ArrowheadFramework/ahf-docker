= authorization =

This directory holds a container for running the Arrowhead Framework V3.2 authorization control service core services.

The core services contained here were implemented by AITIA International Inc., and the source code can be found [https://github.com/hegeduscs/arrowhead here].

== Instructions ==

=== Running locally ===

Build this container by running the following command from this directory.

<pre>docker build --tag ahf-auth-control .</pre>
If you are running a container with a database prepared for Arrowhead 3.2, such as the one located in <code>core/mysql/</code> and that container is connected to a Docker network named, for example, <code>ahf</code>. You can run this container as follows:

<pre>docker run --rm --network ahf --name ahf-auth-control ahf-auth-control</pre>
== Tests ==

These tests assume that the container is located at <code>auth.docker.ahf</code>. To have your operating system recognize this hostname, you may modify your hosts file or use DNS resolution. See [[#Helpful-commands|Helpful commands]] for an example on modifying the hosts file.

You can find the test commands under <code>doc/requests</code>. Soon they will be included here as well.

=== Query ===

== Helpful commands ==

Get the IP address of the container (where <code>ahf-auth-control</code> is the name of the container):

<pre>docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' \
    ahf-auth-control</pre>
Update or add a hosts entry with the container address:

<pre># Configuration (modify as needed
sr_hostname=&quot;auth.docker.ahf&quot;
sr_container_name=&quot;ahf-auth-control&quot;

# Get current container address
sr_address=$(docker inspect -f \
    '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' \
    &quot;$sr_container_name&quot;)

# Comment out any previous entries for that host
sudo sed -Ei &quot;s/(^[1-9].*$sr_hostname)/#\1/&quot; /etc/hosts

# Add new host entry
[ -n &quot;$sr_address&quot; ] &amp;&amp; echo &quot;$sr_address $sr_hostname&quot; | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

# Verify
cat /etc/hosts</pre>
