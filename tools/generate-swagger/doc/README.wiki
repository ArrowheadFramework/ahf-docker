This is a tool for extracting documentation from the JAX-RS implementation of the core services. All of the services use JAX-RS and therefore all can be extracted.

''Please note that this is just a containerization around Sebastian Daschner's thesis result <code>jaxrs-analyzer</code> released under the Apache-2.0 license applied to the Arrowhead Framework 3.2 core services by AITIA International Inc.''

Assuming you were interested in extracting documentation for the authorization control service, you would do the following:

<pre>docker build --tag tools-generate-payloads .
docker run --rm -it tools-generate-payloads authorization &gt; auth-ctrl.json</pre>
Then, you can go to [https://editor.swagger.io/ the Swagger Editor] and use this file to view the documentation in a nice format and generate client stubs.

The idea is for this container to also generate the documentation as a HTML document without the need to go to through the swagger editor, but please be patient.

This could also be then used to generate documentation in other formats, and that might be done in the future.

== Examples ==

<pre>docker run --rm -it tools-generate-payloads authorization &gt; auth-ctrl.json

docker run --rm -it tools-generate-payloads serviceregistry &gt; sr.json

docker run --rm -it tools-generate-payloads orchestrator &gt; orch.json

docker run --rm -it tools-generate-payloads gatekeeper &gt; gatekeeper.json

docker run --rm -it tools-generate-payloads gateway &gt; gateway.json

docker run --rm -it tools-generate-payloads qos &gt; qos.json

docker run --rm -it tools-generate-payloads api &gt; api.json</pre>
